This is work in progress.  I wrote it to help my daugther with her piano lessons.
The program will randomly display a note on the music staff.
It will then wait until it can hear the correct note.
Once the correct note is heard, it will display a new random note.

Most of the FFT code is from samples I found on the internet.  It's probably not optimal and I couldn't determine correct octaves.
If it detects a C (do), it will accept any octave C to be the correct one.
